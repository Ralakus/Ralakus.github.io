<h1 id="about">About</h1>

<h1 id="we-ve-never-had-a-place-to-belong-so-together-we-search-aimlessly">We’ve never had a place to belong. So together we search aimlessly.</h1>

<h2 id="formation-2004-2006">Formation (2004-2006)</h2>

<p>Zach, Max, and Mikhail all met in High School in a small town in Virginia to form Together Searching Aimlessly, a heavily electronically and classically influenced group, who have gone on to see moderate commercial success and a growing cult following. They started making music in a friends basement in 2004, and recorded many of their first songs with low-budget instruments, recording methods, and production. They played in small restaurants and bars to gain a small following.</p>

<h2 id="early-years-2007-2009">Early Years (2007-2009)</h2>

<p>By late 2006, they began to invest in getting better equipment, and their overall sound quality experienced a steady rise. They released a collection of songs they recorded as a self-titled album on March 4, 2007. While not receiving much in the way of commercial success initially, it gained a small audience on small platforms such as Youtube. Max once stated in an interview that his part on the track “Birds on the Wire” was recorded through the microphone of an old laptop he had since he was 15. The band was able to put the relatively small amount of money they made from the album and doing shows towards buying even more equipment. By this point, the three members had each found a niche in the group, with Max doing most of the vocals, Zach primarily working with production, and Mikhail doing much of the instrumentation. The band did not do much touring before beginning work on their next album in the summer of 2009.</p>

<h2 id="sitting-ducks-2010">Sitting Ducks (2010)</h2>

<p>In the summer of 2009, they began work on their sophomore album, to be called “Sitting Ducks (All In A Row), which was released on the 25th of October, in 2010. After this, they did a short North American tour in promotion of the album lasting through the end of November. The album still receive little attention, and most critics gave the album only slightly positive reviews. After this tour, the band uploaded a video to their Youtube channel telling the audience that the band was going on an indefinite hiatus while the band members all finished university.</p>

<h2 id="hiatus-2011-2016">Hiatus (2011-2016)</h2>

<p>From the time Together Searching Aimlessly went on hiatus in late 2010, they remained mostly inactive for the next 6 years. In late 2016, the band reformed, ending their hiatus, and they immediately began work on their comeback album, “Fall of the Fall”, released on December 22, 2017.
Recent Years/Commercial Success (2017-)
The band’s 2017 album, “Fall of the Fall” received the most commercial attention of all their albums, with the single “Yellow” making its way to many year end lists for indie, alternative, and electronic fans. This newfound attention prompted them to spend the first half of 2018 touring the world, co-headlining with Kraftwerk, one of the bands biggest inspirations and influences. After this tour, the band came back to the studio, now inspired from their travels to write another album, “The Run”, released on April 9, 2019. The singles “Media” and “Scene 6729” both made it onto the Billboard Electronic charts, debuting at #68 and #97 respectively, and “Media” also made it to the Indie charts, debuting at #78. The band is planning the “Three Guys, Three Keyboards, Three Songs Southeastern Tour for the summer of 2019 in promotion of this album.</p>
